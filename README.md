#Music
It is an experimental project for making scaleless music.
##About
IMHO:
* Music should only contain [harmonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmony) relations between notes.
* All of the harmonic relation variations should be possible to create.

The realization of these conditions is mathematically impossible with any musical [scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(music)), therefore real music should be scaleless. On "scaleless" I mean the frequency of the notes are not chosen from a fixed set (= scale), instead they are calculated dynamically in relation of the previous notes.

For example: the popular [equal temperament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_temperament) contains only one type of harmonic relation, the octave, all the other relations are disharmonic ones in it.

##Development
:construction: It is in very early stage yet!

It compiles with Rust nightly (PortAudio needed). Temporarily generates some sounds if you press some keys on the keyboard (Q..P, A..L).

Tasks:
- [ ] I need time and money (for living)
- [ ] :book: proper documentation
- [ ] effects
- [ ] low delay input devices
- [ ] file format, parser
- [ ] GUI
- [ ] 3D effects
- [ ] other stuff
