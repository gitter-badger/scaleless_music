#Music
:construction: It is an experimental project for making scaleless music.
##About
IMHO:
* Music should only contain [harmonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmony) relations between notes.
* All of the harmonic relation variations should be possible to create.

The realization of these conditions is mathematically impossible with any musical [scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(music)), therefore real music should be scaleless.

For comparison: the popular [equal temperament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_temperament) contains only one type of harmonic relation, the octave, and a lot of disharmonic ones.

##Development
It is in very early stage yet!

Tasks:
- [ ] I need time and money (for living)
- [ ] :book: proper documentation
- [ ] effects
- [ ] low delay input devices
- [ ] file format, parser
- [ ] GUI
- [ ] 3D effects
- [ ] other stuff
